 Description
This Java program demonstrates the use of primitive data types, user input handling, arithmetic operations, type casting, variable scope, and formatted output.  
It is designed to help understand core Java fundamentals clearly.

 Features
- Declaration and display of all Java primitive data types
- Accepts user input using the Scanner class
- Performs basic arithmetic operations
- Demonstrates implicit and explicit type casting
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Uses formatted output with System.out.printf
- Shows the difference between local, instance, and static variables

 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Eclipse IDE

 Files Included
- `DataTypeDemonstration.java` – Main Java source file
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- Screenshot of output (Eclipse Console)

 How to Run the Program
1. Open Eclipse IDE
2. Create a new Java Project
3. Create a new Java class named `DataTypeDemonstration`
4. Paste the code into the class
5. Run the program using **Run → Run As → Java Application**
6. Enter integer values when prompted
7. View output in the Eclipse Console

Sample Output
- Displays primitive data types and memory usage
- Accepts two integers from the user
- Shows sum, difference, product, and division
- Demonstrates type casting and variable scope
